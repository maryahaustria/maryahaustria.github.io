### Projects

**Sentiment Classification with Feed-Forward Neural Network**  
**[View Project: Sentiment Classification](assets/img/Feed-Forward Neural Network for Sentiment Classification.pdf)**  

•	Developed and trained a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) for sentiment classification using Python, TF-IDF, and data preprocessing.
•	 Tuned hyperparameters, including hidden size (20), learning rate (0.0001), and epochs (100), which improved prediction accuracy to 83%, evaluated through accuracy, confusion matrix, and precision/recall metrics.
•	Implemented model pipelines using Python, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, aligning with modern AI/ML practices.
•	Applied the FFNN method to news detection, working collaboratively with a team to research and analyze existing methods in the domain of fake news detection.
•	Combined news data with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and FFNN models, conducting experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches.
•	Co-authored a research paper detailing our methodology and findings, focusing on improving existing fake news detection methods by integrating state-of-the-art techniques.
•	Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to improve the accuracy and relevance of predictions in real-world applications.


**Sleep Quantity and Cardiovascular Disease Risk**  
**[View Project: Sleep Quantity Analysis](assets/img/BloodPressureVSsleep.pdf)**  
**[View Project: Sleep Quantity Analysis](assets/img/LDLandTriVSsleep.pdf)**  
•	Conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on healthcare data from NHANES, analyzing sleep patterns' impact on cardiovascular health using R, Tableau, and Excel.
•	Performed regression analysis and presented findings with visualization tools to support healthcare decisions. Results indicated that other socioeconomic and health factors, such as income level and access to healthcare, should also be considered to fully understand cardiovascular health risks
