### Projects

**Sentiment Classification with Feed-Forward Neural Network**  
**[View Project: Sentiment Classification](assets/img/Feed-Forward Neural Network for Sentiment Classification.pdf)**  
- Developed and trained a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) for sentiment classification using Python, TF-IDF, and data preprocessing.
- Tuned hyperparameters, including hidden size (20), learning rate (0.0001), and epochs (100), which improved prediction accuracy to 83%, evaluated through accuracy, confusion matrix, and precision/recall metrics.
- Implemented model pipelines using Python, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, aligning with modern AI/ML practices.
- Applied the FFNN method to news detection, working collaboratively with a team to research and analyze existing methods in the domain of fake news detection.
- Combined news data with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and FFNN models, conducting experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches.
- Co-authored a research paper detailing our methodology and findings, focusing on improving existing fake news detection methods by integrating state-of-the-art techniques.
- Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to improve the accuracy and relevance of predictions in real-world applications.

**Sleep Quantity and Cardiovascular Disease Risk**

**[View Project: Sleep Quantity Analysis](assets/img/LDLandTriVSsleep.pdf)**  
- Conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on healthcare data from NHANES, analyzing sleep patterns' impact on cardiovascular health using R, Tableau, and Excel.
- Performed regression analysis and presented findings with visualization tools to support healthcare decisions. Results indicated that other socioeconomic and health factors, such as income level and access to healthcare, should also be considered to fully understand cardiovascular health risks.

**Credit Card Fraud Detection**  
**[View Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection](assets/img/Credit Card Fraud Detection.pdf)**  
- Implemented machine learning models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost) using Python and SMOTE to address class imbalance in fraudulent transaction detection.
- Evaluated models using Logistic Regression with confusion matrices and classification reports, and XGBoost with ROC-AUC analysis, achieving high accuracy and effective fraud detection.

**Question Answering System**  
**[View Project: Question Answering System](assets/img/Question Answering System.pdf)**  
- Built an NLP-based question-answering system using Python, retrieving information from Wikipedia, and summarizing content efficiently with a 70% text reduction.

**Amazon Prime Video Dashboard**  
**[View Project: Amazon Prime Dashboard](assets/img/Amazon Prime Video Dashboard.pdf)**  
- Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze over 100 years of Amazon Prime Video content (1920â€“2021).
- Visualized total shows and movies, content distribution by country, and genre breakdown.
- Integrated advanced filters for year, country, and genre to enable customized insights.
- Highlighted regional trends, genre popularity, and historical content patterns.
- Provided actionable insights for content acquisition, marketing strategies, and regional growth plans.
